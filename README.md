On March 13, 2025, I completed C programming through the book "Coding Success by Programmers" provided by Programmers and began focusing on learning algorithms. 
While implementing various algorithms through this book, I encountered several challenging codes that required a lot of reflection and practice. 
Among these, there were concepts that I could understand theoretically but found difficult to implement and execute in actual code.
At first, I struggled with understanding the implementation methods of algorithms and was unsure how to optimize the code, which led to many mistakes.
In particular, selecting the appropriate data structures and algorithms to solve problems took time, and I encountered obstacles along the way.
However, as I worked through these difficulties step by step, I was able to understand and apply the code more effectively.
For example, I tackled problems ranging from basic ones like sorting algorithms to advanced ones such as Dynamic Programming.
While implementing these algorithms, I made an effort to thoroughly understand how the code works and considered ways to optimize the algorithms for efficiency.
Some of the problems I solved in this book were initially more challenging than expected, requiring multiple revisions and experiments. 
However, through this process, I gained a lot of experience and came to a deeper understanding of the importance of time complexity analysis and optimization.
